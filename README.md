## 📊 Project Overview

**Live App URL**: [http://www.0xnotes.lol](#)

Daily Death Estimate is a **real-time, cinematic web experience** that visualizes global deaths by cause — not as cold data, but as an emotional constellation. Each death cause orbits a central pulse, scaled by impact, drifting in smooth motion while silently counting the lives lost.

This app was fully ideated, designed, and developed by **JadeOfwallstreet**, using modern frontend technologies and a data-driven storytelling approach.
